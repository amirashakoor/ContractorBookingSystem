                Please note that not everyone working on site is required to obtain a permit. <br>
                Permits are mandatory only for contractors performing tasks that are classified as high-risk. <br>
                Additionally, if you are working on landlord property or need access to an area <br>
                controlled by Cabot Circus/Hammerson, a permit will be required. <br>
                Ensuring the safety of our staff, contractors, and customers is our top priority, <br>
                and we appreciate your cooperation in adhering to these requirements.
